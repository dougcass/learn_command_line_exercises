##Remove Directory (rmdir)

##Do More

###Make 20 more directories and remove them all

###Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time like I did above.

##Questions:

###Can you remove the tmp directory?
'rmdir tmp'
No you cannot remove the tmp directory because the directory is not empty.
