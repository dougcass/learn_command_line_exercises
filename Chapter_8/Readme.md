##Moving Around (pushd) (popd)

##Do More

##Explain what directories you visited in the readme


##Pushd and Popd in my own words:
Pushd places a directory in a que for future use.  Pushd directories 
are stacked like plates, one on top of the other.  Popd removes the top plate
in the stack of directories you have created and takes you to the directory below the removed directory.
